java bro...fav

Java is one of the most important and belonging to the core part of programming


-->so java well planned and covered with a parts like java virtual machine and java runtime Enviroment on top of os
  
                                            (jdk->jre->jvm)


-->Automatically byte code is creaated with the extension of .class

-->jvm+libraries=jre(java runtime enivorment)

-->java is wora ->write once read anywhere

procedure of java functioning-:

step 1)User writes a java codes using.java a and then javac compiles to bit format

step2.) byt code is class file format this files is taken towards jre  and then jre -> os 

step 3.)all things are interelated

step 4.)every year java might changes but its base remains same through the 10years...

Software is process to solve the problem and find solution

-->In this world every problem is solved using virtual world (software) -->amazon,uber,bms etc,banking
 
 -->while solving and analzying the most important element is data(it is received and created and stored0

features-:

Java is strongly typed language. This means in order to use a variable it must be declared with its type. The variables once declared of some type cannot be changed to other type but its value can be changed to other value of same type.


                                          RUNTIME VS COMPILE TIME

Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.


*Dataypes characterisitics:	

-->char takes 2bytes in java (bigger range than other languages) by default double is taken

-->byte is in range of -128 to 127

-->for float and long we have to specify with their appearance in java compiler


object

Every object in this world know 2 things
--> It know something      ---> It does something

class is like a blueprint to create objects in this programming world

It nurtures the object way and create into newer format with high end specifications


class is used to design certain things but it design wont enough we need manfacturing unit also

object is key to place to represent to handle and call classs


static variable

-->whenever we create a class with respective objects and its elements..

-->We have to use class name to call and change the following value of the variable 

static String name // can be the used type inform of static / which is common throught out the following variable



USUAGE OF STATIC IN STATIC MAIN.

-->To simply using main func we need object class but without creating main func how can we create object so that whenever
deadlock happens so to avoid and create object we use static main dude


---->  Why capital letter for string in java?

 high-level objects/classes are named uppercase (CamelCase). That's just the way Java was designed.


INHERITANCE IN JAVA

Genrally inheritance is concept of oops were the following features are inherited from one class to other with the following cases

in a simple way child/sub/derived class is getting inherited of special qualities from parent/superset/base 

-->The basic functon again resued into multiple functions of various new classes rather rewriting just refer the class
